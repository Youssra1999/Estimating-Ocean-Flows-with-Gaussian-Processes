# Estimating Ocean Flows with Gaussian Processes

The Philippine Archipelago is a fascinating multiscale ocean region. Its geometry is complex, with multiple straits, islands, steep shelf-breaks, and coastal features, leading to partially interconnected seas and basins. In this part, we will be studying, understanding, and navigating through the ocean current flows.

The data has been provided by the MSEAS research group at MIT ([MSEAS Website](http://mseas.mit.edu/)). The flow field is from a data-assimilative multiresolution simulation obtained using their MSEAS primitive-equation ocean modeling system. It simulates tidal flows to larger-scale dynamics in the region, assimilating a varied set of gappy observations.
